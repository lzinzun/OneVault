# OneVault
This application is a personal trek to learn, not only the basics of password managing and encryption, but as well as Android development w the pupose to solidy knowledge in object-oriented programming (Kotlin), databases (Realm DB), UI/UX, and other common standards such as Documentation, Automated Testing, and necesary security components that need to be added in order to deliver concrete projects.

There is no commercial intent for this application, this is wholy a recerational project.

More information to be updated (i.e. Installation, Stack involved...)
